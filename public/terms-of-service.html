    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <div class="muted">Last updated: September 2025</div>

    <p>These Terms govern your use of the Precision Appraisal Zone (“PAZ”, “we”, “us”) website and services.
      By using our site or engaging our services, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>Services</h2>
    <p>We provide independent auto appraisal services including Diminished Value (DV), Loss of Use (LoU),
      and Total Loss valuation support. Reports are expert opinions based on available data and market analysis;
      they are not guarantees of outcomes.</p>

    <h2>No Legal or Insurance Services</h2>
    <p>We are not a law firm or insurance company and do not provide legal advice or sell insurance.
      You should consult your attorney for legal advice.</p>

    <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide accurate and complete information (e.g., estimates, invoices, photos, correspondence).</li>
      <li>Disclose any prior accidents or relevant conditions affecting value.</li>
      <li>Use reports only for lawful purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Fees &amp; Refunds</h2>
    <p>Fees are due as quoted. Rush fees may apply. Our guarantee: if your insurer doesn’t increase the offer
      by at least the cost of your PAZ report within 60 days—and you followed our negotiation steps—we’ll refund your fee.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>Reports and site content are owned by PAZ. You receive a limited license to use deliverables for your claim or legal matter.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, PAZ is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages.
      Our total liability shall not exceed the fees you paid for the applicable service.</p>

    <h2>Standards &amp; Licensing</h2>
    <p>PAZ operates with a Florida <strong>620</strong> Adjuster License. USPAP coursework is in progress; when complete,
      we may update these Terms accordingly.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law &amp; Disputes</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by Florida law. Venue for disputes lies in the state courts of Miami-Dade County, Florida,
      or the appropriate U.S. federal court in Florida.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms; continued use constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>
